        <h3>AI-based Adaptive Learning Systems</h3>

        <h4> <u>My Favourite AI Idea </u></h4>
        <p>AI-based adaptive learning systems study students' learning patterns and adjust how they teach based on how students learn.</p>

        <h4> <u>Application in My World </u></h4>
        <p>As a visual leaner, I sometimes struggle to understand concepts when I have to be reading for hours. An AI-based adaptive learning system could detect that I learn better through visuals and provide relevant videos of concepts that I need help with.</p>

        <h4><u>Why It Would Be Useful</u></h4>
        <p>It personalises the learning experience and makes it easier for usstudents to learn concepts.</p>

        <h4><u>Ethical Issues</u></h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b> Data Privacy</b> — There needs to be policies in place to ensure that students' learning data is stored securely and not shared without our consent.</li>
            <li><b>Overuse/Abuse of the system</b> — It is important for us students to utilise our critical thinking skills and not always rely on the LMS to help us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><u>My Solutions</u></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Data should automatically be protected and students must consent to it being shared with other parties.</li>
            <li>Students should be encouraged to understand concepts on their own before using the platform.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><u>Example</u></h4>
        <p><b>Khan Academy</b> uses AI to personalise learning paths.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title" style="text-align:center;">TWELVE PILLARS </h3>
    <div class="re-body">

        <h4><u>Chapter 4 – Goals</u></h4>
        <p>When I was younger, I would fill books with my ideas and creative pieces. Overtime, I stopped and this chapter reminded me just how important writing down my goals are. It sets things in motion.</p>

        <h4><u>Chapter 5 – Time</u></h4>
        <p>I became a huge procrastinator towards the end of high school. And now, even in college, I am struggling to overcome this. However, time management is a life-skill, so I have created schedules that I am trying to stick to. Prioritising tasks based on importance matters.</p>

        <h4><u>Chapter 6 – People</u></h4>
        <p>"Show me your company, and I will tell you who you are".</p>
	<p>I have made it my aim to look for meaningful friendships and to be a good friend to others. If I want people around me who will push me to be a better version of myself, then I also need to be that person for others.</p>

        <h4><u>Chapter 7 – Learning</u></h4>
        <p>Graduating with my BSc. is not the end of my learning journey. I am an avid believer in continuously learning and improving on my skills and talents. </p>
